# Campaign Wiki

After a Nous campaign finishes, its knowledge lives in raw `ledger.json` and
`principles.json` files. The wiki skills extract that knowledge into structured,
self-contained files and render them as interactive visualizations.

## Skills

### `/post-campaign`

Extracts structured knowledge from a completed campaign and produces a
visualization.

**Usage:**

```
/post-campaign path/to/.nous/my-campaign
```

If no path is given, the skill searches for campaign directories and asks you
to pick one.

**What it reads** (from the campaign directory):

| File | What it provides |
|------|------------------|
| `ledger.json` | Iteration outcomes (CONFIRMED/REFUTED), prediction accuracy |
| `principles.json` | Full principle definitions (statement, mechanism, bounds) |
| `campaign.yaml` | Research question, target system name, repo path |

**What it writes** (to `~/.nous/wiki/campaigns/<name>/`):

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `dead-ends.json` | Approaches that were tried and conclusively failed |
| `frontiers.json` | Boundary conditions — where knowledge ends |
| `interactions.json` | Untested combinations of confirmed techniques |
| `concepts.json` | Knowledge graph: entities, concepts, parameters with linkage |
| `summaries.json` | Per-iteration narratives (what was tried, what was found) |
| `principles.json` | Copy of the campaign's principles (for downstream consumers) |
| `llm_metrics.jsonl` | Copy of per-call cost data (if it exists) |
| `summary.md` | Human-readable campaign summary |

It also generates `~/.nous/wiki/viz/<name>.html` — an interactive HTML page
with tabs for the knowledge graph, iteration timeline, insights, and summary.

**Idempotency:** If the campaign was already indexed (i.e., `concepts.json`
exists in the wiki), extraction is skipped and only the visualization is
regenerated.

**What doesn't happen:** This skill never modifies the campaign's own files.
It only reads from the campaign directory and writes to `~/.nous/wiki/`.

### `/visualize-campaign`

Re-renders a campaign's HTML visualization from existing wiki data. Does not
extract or modify any knowledge files.

**Usage:**

```
/visualize-campaign path/to/.nous/my-campaign
```

**Prerequisites:** The campaign must have already been indexed by
`/post-campaign`. If `concepts.json` or `summaries.json` don't exist in
`~/.nous/wiki/campaigns/<name>/`, the skill tells you to run `/post-campaign`
first.

**What it does:**
1. Finds the campaign name from `campaign.yaml` or the directory name
2. Runs the visualization script on the existing wiki data
3. Opens the generated HTML in the browser

Use this when you want to regenerate the HTML (e.g., after updating the
visualization script) without re-running the full extraction.

## Output Data Model

All output lives under `~/.nous/wiki/` — a user-level directory outside any
repo. Each campaign gets its own subdirectory.

```
~/.nous/wiki/
├── campaigns/
│   └── <campaign-name>/
│       ├── concepts.json
│       ├── summaries.json
│       ├── principles.json
│       ├── dead-ends.json
│       ├── frontiers.json
│       ├── interactions.json
│       ├── llm_metrics.jsonl
│       └── summary.md
└── viz/
    └── <campaign-name>.html
```

### dead-ends.json

Approaches that were tested and conclusively don't work. Each entry is
self-contained — you can understand what failed without reading any other file.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "DE-1",
    "title": "Gradient-dampened saturation detection under sustained overload",
    "iteration": "iter-1",
    "what_was_tried": "A gradient-aware saturation detector with dampening factor 0.8...",
    "why_it_failed": "In-flight count grows monotonically during overload, making gradient always positive...",
    "avoid_when": "arrival_rate > drain_rate, any cluster size"
  }
]
```

### frontiers.json

Boundary conditions where knowledge runs out. Each frontier tells you what was
explored, what wasn't, and what to try next.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "F-1",
    "title": "Multi-instance scaling beyond 2 instances",
    "what_was_tried": "All experiments used 1-2 instances with rate 20-200...",
    "what_was_left_untried": "3+ instance clusters with rate > 200...",
    "what_to_try_next": "Run confirmed hybrid at threshold=0.7 with 4 instances, rate=400",
    "related_principles": ["RP-5", "RP-18"]
  }
]
```

### interactions.json

Untested combinations of independently-confirmed techniques that might produce
compound gains when used together.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "I-1",
    "title": "Confirmed hybrid detector + multi-instance priority dispatch",
    "approach_a": "Hybrid detector at threshold=0.7 provides 8.6% critical improvement (1-instance)...",
    "approach_b": "Priority dispatch reduces p99 latency by 12% under 2-instance mixed workloads...",
    "why_combine": "Both operate on orthogonal mechanisms — combining might provide gains across the full scale range...",
    "experiment_to_run": "Run hybrid threshold=0.7 + priority dispatch with 2 instances, rate=200, mixed-SLO",
    "related_principles": ["RP-8", "RP-17", "RP-18"]
  }
]
```

### concepts.json

The campaign's knowledge graph — entities (pre-existing code components),
concepts (techniques the campaign discovered), and parameters (tunable knobs).

The graph has directed ownership: `Entity ←(operates_on)← Concept →(owns)→ Parameter`.

Key rules:
- Entities existed in the codebase before the campaign ran
- Concepts are techniques the campaign discovered and validated
- Each parameter belongs to exactly one concept
- Every concept operates on at least one entity

### summaries.json

Per-iteration narratives used by the visualization's iteration timeline.

```json
{
  "iter-0": {
    "what_was_tried": "Baseline measurement with default configuration...",
    "what_was_found": "Established reference p99=230ms, throughput=142 req/s. BASELINE.",
    "why_it_matters": "Provides comparison point for all subsequent iterations."
  },
  "iter-1": {
    "what_was_tried": "Gradient-dampened saturation detector with dampening=0.8...",
    "what_was_found": "No improvement over baseline. REFUTED.",
    "why_it_matters": "Eliminated gradient approach under sustained overload (RP-1)."
  }
}
```

## Scripts

The skills call two Python scripts. You can also run them directly.

### `scripts/validate_concepts.py`

Checks a `concepts.json` file for graph integrity errors: orphaned parameters,
unreachable entities, parameters owned by multiple concepts, broken references.

```bash
python scripts/validate_concepts.py ~/.nous/wiki/campaigns/my-campaign/concepts.json
```

Exits 0 if valid, non-zero with error messages if not.

### `scripts/visualize_campaign.py`

Generates an interactive HTML page from campaign data.

```bash
python scripts/visualize_campaign.py path/to/.nous/my-campaign \
  --summaries ~/.nous/wiki/campaigns/my-campaign/summaries.json \
  --concepts ~/.nous/wiki/campaigns/my-campaign/concepts.json
```

Reads `dead-ends.json` from the wiki directory automatically. Produces
`~/.nous/wiki/viz/<campaign-name>.html` and opens it in the default browser.

The HTML includes:
- **Iterations tab** — timeline with clickable nodes showing per-iteration detail
- **Knowledge tab** — force-directed graph of entities, concepts, and parameters
- **Insights tab** — dead-ends, frontiers, and interactions as browsable cards
- **Summary tab** — the campaign's narrative summary with key principles
